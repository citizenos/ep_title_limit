# Plugin to override etherpad and it's plugins translations

This plugin helps to display users if document title is limited. In case document is exported to other systems and there are title limits, this plugin higlights the part of title that gets trimmed and also displays user an info modal.

``` javascript
"ep_title_limit": {
    "maxLength": "<integer>" //length of characters in title, whitespace after is trimmed
  }
```
